If you need an online portfolio of your personal and work projects. If you want to create your blog or business site and don't know how to start. If you don't want to deal or pay for website hosting, domain names and all everything else to launch or website

This one's for you!

### Why should I have a website?

Nowadays, it's really hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't benefit from having his own website. You might need to display your portfolio for potential employers or as a freelance. You might need to display your student proyects and share it with all the University Community. You might create your own blog about places you've been or what you're doing. You might need to advertise yourself or your business and open your own shop online...

A website is the play to connect yourself with the world and the best communication tool. It's how you can create, build and control your online image. Plus, the sooner you build your place, the more time you'll have to build your online presence and reach the people you want to reach. It can help you stand out in of competitors.

And, we all know that it's also not the easiest thing if you don't know what you're doing!

If you are a beginner, surely you have heard about some simplest options. The main one is Wordpress, but I want to introduce to Github.

Wordpress is the excelence beginners tool! You only have to configure some parameters and start writing. It's great for those who want to create a site fast and without any technical knowledge. The main problem with Wordpress is that you can't configure almost nothing with the free plan. It's too obvius that you are using Wordpress, you have to use Wordpress logo, your domain has wordpress.com and customization and templates are minimal.

If you are a begginer tech person, you will know Github like a code repository for sure. If you are in tech world and love to program, for sure you will have a Github account with at least one project. But maybe you don't know about Github Pages functionality. You can create your web in Github and host it directly there, in your code repository, and needing no more.

If you are really jealous of your code, or want to keep your site code in secret, this article might end it here for you. Putting your code on Github shows that you like contributing to open source philosophy. You can help and inspire everyone who cames after with your ideas. That's the big Githup idea, share knowledge and work. When you share your proects on Github, people can see your code, what you're doing, how you're doing, they can suggest some improvements or features. It's like the Alexandria library of code nowadays.
retty much everyone in tech right now is using Git and Github in some way. Having your website right there is a plus, and it will sind up with a repository and some commints on your profile page =)

If you're a total brand new to everything Git and Github, you might want to check my previous post "Getting Started with Git and GitHub: the total beginner's guide". That article will show you the basics of Git and Github, concepts like "repository" or "branch". 

From now on I'm assuming that you know the basics.

So, there we go!


### Let's start with my web!

There are two ways of getting started with your website. You might be starting completely from scratch! You don't have anything, neither index.html file. On the other hand you might have a website that you've already design and put together, but you don't know how to use Github to launch it as a free website.

### I have my website files, but I don't know what to do with them!

This is the simplest case. Github will make all the work for you. Asumming that you already have a Github account and you know what a respository is, if not, you should check my previous article about how to start with Git and Github.

A repository is like a eggshell, where your project will live. That is the place where you'll keep your folders, add images, videos and anything else your project needs in your repository.

If you haven't already, go ahead and initialize your project with a repository, or create a new repository and upload all your files. If you have a file called `index.html` Github will understand what you wnat to do.

Now you're going to learn about taking advange of Github Pages. Go to your Github repository and click `Settings`
![github settings](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Once we are at settings page, you have to make scroll down until the `Github Pages` section.
![github pages](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_pages.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Now drop the `Source` dropdown menu and select `Master branch` option. This will make that our website take the home page the master branch of our reository, it's pretty much publish your repositori as-is.
![github pages source](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_pages_source.png){:class="img-fluid"}

You are going to see a notification that your site is ready to be published.
![github publishing](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_publishing.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Be patient, wait a minute or two, and then refresh the page or try the link if you wante. Once your site has been published, the notification has changed, your site has been published, you'll see this:
![github published](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_published.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Try clicking on that link and MAGIC!

You have a published free website!


### I don't know how to get started!

I'm not gonna explain how to create a website, neither all design librarys you can use, this is the basics.
I prefer that you know how to create something from zero with the tool that I'm introducing here and then, with all your time and motivation available explore all this new world. This option is for total beginners, I'm going to show how to do everything on the Github to create a website.

Well, go ahead and first thing, create a new repository.
![github repository](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_new_repo.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Fill in with all your repository data: name, descripcion and select the option to initialize the repository with a README `Initialize this repository with a README` and then click `Create repository`
![github create](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_create_repo.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Now, the same as previous section, you have to go to `Settings` section, near the top right-hand side of the screen.
![github settings](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Once you are here, scroll down to `Github Pages` section.
![github pages](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_pages.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Drop the dropdown `Source` menu and select `Master branch` option.
![github pages source](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_pages_source.png){:class="img-fluid"}

First, you will see a notification like your site is ready to be published.
![github publishing](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_publishing.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Please, be patient, this might take some minutes, then refresh the page and you will see like notification has changed and show that your site has been published with the web domain where you could visit your web.
![github published](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_settings_published.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Now click in the link:
![github web](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_basic_web.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Congratulations! You are online!


### But, this is really ugly.

Oks, you are right, this website is really ugly and boring. If you come back to your repository, you can see that what is showing is your `README.md` file.
![github readme](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_readme.png){:class="img-fluid"}

If you want to make some quick changes, you can go ahead and edit your file to display what you want people to see. To do that, go back into your repository, click the little pencil icon in your README file and make it better!
![github edit readme](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_edit_readme.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Don't forget to commit your README file changes! If you don't do that, you will loose all the work. You can also add a short commit message explaining all the changes.
![github commit readme](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_commit_readme.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Keep in mind that you are editing a Markdown file. If you don't know about this format, visit the [Markdown Getting Started Official Site](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for anyone who hasn't worked with it before.

This kind of files are a programming languate, this post is written in Markdown format, where you can add element formats writting plain text. There are a lot of things that you can add to with this files, like adding images, colors, links or even programming code.
If you are curious about this format, explore the [Basic Syntax Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Now go back to your web domain, and see how it looks the last changes!
![github web2](/assets/img/posts/ghpages/gh_basic_web2.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Be aware that sometimes takes a few minutes for the changes to go through your published web. Try waiting a couple of minutes and refreshing. You can also have to delete your browser cache or open the link in a privacy browser sesion to see before all the changes.


### That is an improvement, can it get better?

Yes, it can get really better, this is the point where everything start to get interesting. But, I'm going to explain it in a new post where I will introduce Jekyll, the framework wich I used to create this website.
I hope this tutorial has helping to whet your appetite.

Now, have fun!

Thanks for reading!
=)
