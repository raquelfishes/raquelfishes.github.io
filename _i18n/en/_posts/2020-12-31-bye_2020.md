<p>January shows us every end is a new beginning.</p>

It is really curious how we face a new year and the value we have gave to that concrete date. We always think in it as the time to start new goals, new projects and try to finish all that we haven't faced in a full year. When the new year start, those 365 days are full of time for everything... but by true, in the end you even have started a couple of your last year resolutions.

This year, this 2020 has passed us all like a steamroller, and to me first. Like all of you I had my little resolutions and goals. It was also my 30s birthday, I wanted my party to celebrate with everyone, but... could not be.

It has been the year of stoppage. We all had to pull the hand break. We all had to think on the most important things of life, start realizing that we couldn't continue living in a house that only uses to sleep. We had to prove ourselves that we are hyper productive working from home, even if we do our work and lunch in the same table. We learnt to cook, made yoga and meditation, and also had to learnt the people we share our home or start listen to ourselves. And be true, all of us nowadays appreciate a beer on a terrace or a walk in the park.

I am "millenial", that generation that already has passed two economics crisis. As generation we have been demanded to play an adult responsability in that crisis, but I don't an adult standard living. We are the most prepared, with more academic studies and need to prove its worth, but between this two crisis we have not yet had that opportunity...

In any case, we must feel really proud of ourselves, the most of us have helped in all that we could, like the maker movement with our 3D printers. We have taken responsability to take care of our families and acquaintances by getting bored of Netflix from our sofa.

Personally, I have to thank this 2020 year. Thanks to that home time I started this web, learned Alexa Skills and Android Apps. I have rediscovered that despite all the daily programming there are still coding puzzles that can restore my passion as "Advent of Code". I recorded myself with the violin (or ukelele or guitar), I learnt to paint 3D printed figures with nail polish and applauded at 20.00.

And no, this Covid situation will not change just by adding one to the number year, but we can take it as a new beginning, take a run a start over. Relax, take care and enjoy, you survive this last year.
